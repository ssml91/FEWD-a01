FEWD assignment 1

## Introductions

Hello! My name is Sharon. I am currently enrolled in the FEWD program. I really enjoy DIY projects and creating things with my hands and designing websites was something I've always wanted to try. I'm so glad to be able to learn these great skills. I took IMCP before FEWD, and I think they go really well together. Learning how to code has had its challenges, but it's such a wonderful feeling when you finally get it right! I hope to use these skills to create a website for myself, my friends, and eventually to find a job! 

Another one of my hobbies is baking. I enjoy trying out new recipes and challenging myself to make new things! One of my favorite things to bake are banana walnut muffins. The trickiest challenge for me now is mastering macarons. They are the toughest cookies to bake! Small factors like humidity and room temperature can have a big effect on the outcome of these cookies! Again, I like to take on new challenges, so I will continue to make them until I get them just right!

## Here are some more interesting facts about me:

* I've lived in Korea for 3 years working as a teacher.
* I am a plant mom of 7 plants.
* My favorite dog breed is a shiba inu. I want to get one one day!
* I have a birthmark that's slightly shaped like a turtle.

## Here is a picture of a shiba inu:
